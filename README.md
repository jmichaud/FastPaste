FastPaste
---------

A tool to facilitate repetitive text pasting. My intended use is
to make entering user login/account numbers/passwords quickly for
manual app testing.

Currently, values are hardcoded, so clone the repo,and then
add/modify the values you want to be able to quickly transfer 
to the clipboard in the init block in `MainActivity.kt` file.

Considering filling this code out to allow non programmers to
be able to add/edit items for easy pasting...
